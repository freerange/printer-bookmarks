# Printer bookmarks

This is a demo [Printer][] app in the same vein as [Printer mail][], [Printer paint][] and [Printer weather][].

This app makes it really easy to print a bookmark for the book you're currently reading, like this [example bookmark for The Snow Child][].  You can try it yourself by visiting [printer-bookmarks][] on Heroku.
