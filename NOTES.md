I'm hoping that my bookmark service is going to allow someone to enter a link to a book on Amazon and their printer URL in order to print a simple bookmark for that book.

The first thing I did was to create a really simple html page that I could use to test the print preview service.

Once I had that working I moved on to dynamically generating a bookmark for a given Amazon URL.
